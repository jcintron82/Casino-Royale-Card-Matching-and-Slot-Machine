This is a memory matching game which has the added effect of having a slot machine roll happen when a new high score is reached. I originally started this project as a way to solidify my knowledge with React and React hooks and the original plan was to do a Pokemon matching game; perfect right? I quickly realized not only how common matching games were, but just how played out the Pokemon themed ones are. In my quest to do something a bit more original than the stale matching game every new React dev does, Casino Royale was born. 

This application was created with Javascript, React and CSS. It operates by taking the user input and checking for matches (ie: a previously selected tile). If no match, it continues as normal. If it does detect a prior selected tile, the score is calculated. Each consecutive non-repeat tile is a score point and with every new high score iteration, the slot machine automatically runs.

I hope you enjoy my application and if you manage to hit the jackpot on my slot, go and buy yourself a lottery ticket!
